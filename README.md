# Rewards Program

## An example React.js App

### Challenge:

A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase.

A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent between $50 and $100 in each transaction.
(e.g., a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).

Given a record of every transaction during a three-month period, calculate the reward points earned for each customer per month and total.

• Use React JS (do not use TypeScript)
• Simulate an asynchronous API call to fetch data
• Make up a data set to best demonstrate your solution
• Check solution into GitHub

### Installation

Running 'npm install' then 'npm start' on the folder will start the app.

### Notes

Clicking on each customer will bring up an itemized list of purchases and the corresponding number of reward points.

Please excuse the UI look...I'm a somewhat design challenged. Dammit Jim, I'm an engineer, not a designer! I used Material UI to help with styling, but that is the only 3rd party library used.
